# disc-bot

Created a bot in Python that would respond to negative messages with an inspiring quote utilizing repl.it db database, discord.py, os, requests, json, and random that runs 24 hours with UptimeRobot and a script that pings the server
Implemented object-oriented programming, youtube_dl, asyncio, ffmpeg to add a music feature that allows the bot to play, pause, resume, and stop music when title or URL given
